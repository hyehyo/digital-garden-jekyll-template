# Abstract Still Negative
*3D rendering, image post-processing. 2021.*

This is a branch from [[Abstract Still]], which was comissioned by [Shizumi](https://www.instagram.com/__shizumi) for a bag design.  
Here I decided to intervene and drift the feeling to a more personal configuration.

Colors are altered and inverted; underneath the foremost layer lies the original image with it's pink-tone, which seems to be breaking out and distorting the new setting.

The shadows from the right half of the composition seem have turned into **ghosts** or dark liquids. This is what resonates with me the most.
