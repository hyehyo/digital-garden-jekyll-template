# Self-Feeding, Self-Perpetuating Model

The current system lies above some sort of theory, an equation designed to feedback itself and assimilate everything which resides next or resists to it. 

This base program is designed to learn and adapt the means to ever-perpetuate its existence. This includes self-defense mechanisms and entities which learn and arrange themselves to protect the structure, sometimes without even being conscious of the structure or entity purpose, or where are individual efforts being transferred to; those entities function for self-preservation and survival.

Humans play the role of separated consciousness and defense entity; they, by their survival efforts indirectly provide this equation the means to subsist by first and foremost thriving and surviving themselves through various methods, such as exploitation and transformation of natural resources, labor and consenting to established organizations.

Said system didn't have a limit on it's base code and morphs in function of itÂ´s experience and acquired data, resembling a machine learning model. Earth's limited resources will not stop it, it will find its way above earth itself.
