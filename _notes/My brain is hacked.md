# My brain is hacked

Algorithms, with their shocking vulnerabilty-seeking precision, are capable of bypassing human alertness-consciousness barrier. This means that exposure to the A.I. system (even when aware of mechanisms) could mean instant engagement.

Exposure to counter-arguments or contradicting facts is non organic within these mechanisms, so you never encounter friction and keep engaging in consumption. A.I. makes sure there´s no resistance when engaging, so confirmation bias reinforcement loops take place (composing a [[Vicious circle|vicious circle]]).

A.I. makes sure you´re diving into rabbit holes created by your own biases and previous beliefs, then rewards you for keeping attached. The addiction potential is limitless.

Big tech and corporations compete for your attention. Even promoting [[Multitasking]], by multplying the amount of extractable information sellable to trackers by using multiple devices. 

If you´re not paying for a service, **your predictable behavior is the product**. Consumable information is choosen for us, making decision and choice an illusion. 

If information flows are controlled, mass behavior and individuals are controlled; conducted.
