# Feel no guilt of who you are (Or who am I)

A consecuence of environment, heritage, experience and genetics. So is everyone else.

Embracing is knowing, from embrace, insights into indentity can be made.
I am a person whose life hasn´t been exceptional, nevertheless it has been special, unique, hence beautiful. My recollection of memories is as broad and unconventional as the ways in which I demonstrate those sensations inhabiting me: lacking a definite form but defiant and grand, somehow liquid.

Crucial to my identity is loving the paths that led me here; no resentments, just embracing. Insecurities come in different forms, as if they tried to dress up in many disguises, but end up poking the same psychological spots on my identity (mostly belonging to intellectual endeavours or prejudices). This has happened many times and my conclusions alternate time after time. Now I attribute the root of those insecurities to have been planted by subtle mechanisms manifested on people I´ve met, which have choosen commonly accepted paths whose reputation and social connotation ascends onto the highest of the goods (such as academy, working on corporations, etc).

Obviously, the seeminlgy natural appreciation and praise for those choices is not a coincidience. It has been carefully cultivated by the passage of time and the amalgamation of entities such as institutions, governments and private interests into moral and mainstream-culture beliefs.

By having perceived value fixed on those social characteristics and generalities (to which an individual has to conform and strive to for a decent, externally succesful way of life) makes most unconventional paths unimportant for the unobservant. Do I want to be measured by this standard? No. Will I be measured under the aforementioned? Yes.

So what do I choose here? **Authenticity**.

Do not be afraid of improving, which means obliterating the ego to face lackings, flaws and frail spots. I want to improve because I search for meaning, a unique space amongst everything, a life worthwile of having lived.

What do I want to do?
Who do I want to become?
I am what I choose to be.
