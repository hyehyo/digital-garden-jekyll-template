# Haunted

I feel haunted, pull me out <br>
then go off.

Though I go through the limits for you <br>
get up, never <br>
Through the wall, all because you're so clever. <br>

Our time across my eyes; so many ripples, lullaby <br>
Our time across my eyes; so many ripples and I. <br>

Though I go through it with you, so <br>
Through the wall, all because he so clever. <br>

Will I remember that these are my limits? <br>
Within the blue lights remember that these are my limits. <br>
