## Lyrics

I feel haunted, pull me out 
then go off. 

Though I go through the limits for you  
get up, never  
Through the wall, all because you're so clever.  

Our time across my eyes; so many ripples, lullaby  
Our time across my eyes; so many ripples and I.  

Though I go through it with you, so  
Through the wall, all because he so clever.  

Will I remember that these are my limits?  
Within the blue lights remember that these are my limits.
